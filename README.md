## üåü Introduction

API testing is a critical component of modern software development, ensuring that different systems communicate effectively and perform as expected. This repository focuses on testing the **Dmoney REST API** using a combination of Postman and Newman, offering a powerful way to automate and document your API testing efforts.

## ü§î What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of protocols and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted, enabling seamless interaction between various systems.

## üöÄ Why Use APIs?

- **Integration**: APIs enable smooth integration between different applications and services, facilitating data exchange and functional synergy.
- **Automation**: By using APIs, processes can be automated, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing efficiency.
- **Extensibility**: APIs allow developers to extend the capabilities of their applications by connecting with external services and resources.
- **Scalability**: APIs support scalable application architectures, making it easier to build modular and distributed systems.

- **API Documentation**: [Dmoney API Docs](#)
- **Partner Key**: `X-AUTH-SECRET-KEY: ROADTOSDET`

## üõ†Ô∏è Newman Details

**Newman** is a command-line collection runner for Postman, enabling automated execution of Postman collections.

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Install Newman globally using:
  ```bash
  npm install -g newman
  ```
